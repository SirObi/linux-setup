Ensure you have installed Ansible first.  

Execute each installation script with `ansible-playbook` (or `./local/bin/ansible-playbook`):  


### Install zshell and Snap to make next steps easier
`./local/bin/ansible-playbook linux-setup/installation_scripts/linux-setup.yml`  

### Install Visual Studio Code, so that you don't have to use nano
`./local/bin/ansible-playbook linux-setup/installation_scripts/install-visual-studio-code.yml`
